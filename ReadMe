===========

chipShooter is a little python script that helps finding 
where to put componets during PCB hand assemby. 
Give it a try with the accompagning example data by typing "./chipshooter.py".

Usage for your own PCBs:
- create board data following the stuff in directory exampleBoardData :
You will need an image showing the PCB, board.size file, component placement data and BOM.
I get the data exporting it from gEDA, cutting images to board.size, and edititing the BOM
manually to add line number and my personal component 'stock_id's.

- start ./chipShooter
Now you can advance, component by component, using up and down arrows as well 
as page up and down. For each component, the crosshair shows the place where to place it.
Mouswheel, as well as '+' and '-' keys, zoom the image. Mouse middle button allows to pan.


Future work (I would like that to be done.):
- make a  better user interface
- control a 'pick and place' machine:
  All the data is allready there, instead of just showing placement on screen,
  it would be really nice, if there was an interface to our TM240A pick and place.
- data base integration:
  having component stock, bom etc. in a database would help generating more automatically 
  all the files needed : pricing of BOMs throug the web, lists of components to order, assisted 
  association of components in schematic to stock_ids etc.
