chipShooter
===========

"chipShooter" is a little python script showing
where to put components during PCB hand assembly. 
Give it a try with the accompanying example data by typing "./chipshooter.py".

Usage for your own PCBs:
- create board data following the stuff in directory exampleBoardData :
You will need an image showing the PCB, board.size file, component placement data and BOM.
I get the data exporting it from PCB design software (gEDA), cutting images to board.size, and editing the BOM
manually to add line number and my personal component 'stock_id's.

- start ./chipShooter
Now you can advance, component by component, using up and down arrows as well 
as page up and down. For each component, the cross-hair shows the place where to place it.
Mouse wheel, as well as '+' and '-' keys, zoom the image. Mouse middle button allows to pan.


Future work (I would like that to be done.):
- make a  better user interface
- control a 'pick and place' machine:
  All the data is already there, instead of just showing placement on screen,
  it would be really nice, if there was an interface to our TM240A pick and place.
- data base integration:
  having component stock, BOM etc. in a database would help generating more automatically 
  all the files needed : pricing of BOMs through the web, lists of components to order, assisted 
  association of components in schematic to stock_ids etc.
